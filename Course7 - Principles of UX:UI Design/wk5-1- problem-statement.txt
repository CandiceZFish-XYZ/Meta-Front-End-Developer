# Problem Statement

The Little Lemon website currently has no reservation service.

A customer who doesn't like waiting in-line is having trouble with booking tables online 
because she cannot find it.
As a result, she rarely dine-in at Little Lemon restaurant.

An online reservation service must be added to enhance customer conveniency and it must be easy to find.
